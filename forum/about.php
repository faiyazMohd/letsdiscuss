                <p class="lead">Lets Discuss was founded in 2003 by developers, for developers. At first, the community was focused on the Windows Mobile (and subsequently Windows Phone) ecosystems. Designed as the home for those who wanted to do more with their PDAs at the time, including customizing the look and feel to fixing problems and adding new functionality.</p>

                <p class="lead">The heart of Lets Discuss is questions â€” questions that affect the world, questions that explain recent world events, questions that guide important life decisions, and questions that provide insights into why other people think differently. Lets Discuss is a place where you can ask questions that matter to you and get answers from people who have been there and done that. Lets Discuss is where scientists, artists, entrepreneurs, mechanics, and homemakers take refuge from misinformation and incendiary arguments to share what they know. </p>
